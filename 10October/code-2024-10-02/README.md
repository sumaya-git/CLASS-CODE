Inheritance

    Inheritance is an important concept of OOP

    Inheritance creats an IS A/AN relationship between two or more classes.

    A Student is a person
    A Car is a vehicle
    A Dog is an animal
    An apple is a fruit

Common properties

Dog, Cat, Lion are all Animal because they all have some common properties
class SoftwareEngineer(Employee):
Some of the common properties are

    Reproduction
    Respiration
    Excretion
    Growth
    Movement

Naming convention for inheritance

    Superclass vs subclass
    Parent class vs Child class
    Base class vs Derived class

Base Class

    It is a class that is inherited from; it serves as a starting point for the derived classes.

Derived Class

    It is a class that is doing the inheriting; It enhances and expand the base class

base and derived class

The base class is absorbed in the derived class
Why Inheriting?

    The derived class want to redefine or override methods of the base class
    The derived class want to add more methods to the base class

Example

    Analysis, Design, Implementation

Object Oriented Analysis

Idea: Build a switch application

**Requirement

    Employee
        Manager
        Software Engineer

Object Orient Design

    Employee
        Attributes
            salary
            first_name
            last_name
            hired_date
            rate_per_hour
        Behaviors
            get_names()
            get_pay_per_year() # annual pay based on the hourly rate

    Manager
        Attributes
            reports
            travel_perk
        Behaviors
            get_reports()
            request_report()
            travel()

    Software Engineer
        Attributes
            seniority_level
            work_status
        Behaviors
            push_code()
            write_code()
            review_code()

Implementation

Check code in employee.py
Type of Inheritance

    Single Inheritance
    Multiple Inheritance
    Multilevel Inheritance
    Hybrid Inheritance
    Hierarchical inheritance

Single Inheritance

    Hermaphrodite: Snail

Multiple Inheritance

Son(Mother, Father)

Miltilevel Inheritance

Son( Father(Grandfather))

Hierarchical inheritance

Son(Father), Daughter(Father)

Hybrid Inheritance

Son(Father), grandson(Son(Father))

Son(Father(grandfather), Mother(grandmother))

Best Example: Organizational hierarchy structure

MRO -> Method Resolution Order

    MRO is the order in which a method is searched for in an inheritance

How do you check it: ClassName.__mro__

class A:
    def p(self):
        print('From A')
        
class B(A):
    def pp(self):
        print('From B')

class D:
    def p(self):
        print('From D')
        
class C(B, D):
    def p(self):
        print('From C')
        super().p() # call B


C.__mro__ # (__main__.C, __main__.B, __main__.A, __main__.D, object)

c = C()
c.p()
#From C
#From B

Self-study

Visibility (Access Modifier)

    Public
    Protected
    Private

Exercise

Modify the Fruit processing program covered in the previous lesson and apply the concept of inheritance and access modifier
